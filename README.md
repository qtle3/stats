## Scripts

### 1. `stats_calculations.py`

- **Purpose:** Provides functions to perform statistical calculations.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `calculate_mean()`: Computes the average of a list of numbers.
  - `calculate_median()`: Determines the middle value in a sorted list.
  - `calculate_mode()`: Finds the most frequent value in a list.
  - `calculate_variance()`: Measures the dispersion of a set of numbers.
  - `calculate_standard_deviation()`: Calculates the amount of variation in a dataset.
  - `calculate_quartiles()`: Computes the quartiles of a dataset.
  - `get_numbers_from_user()`: Handles user input for numbers.
  
### 2. `stats_user.py`

- **Purpose:** Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with statistical functions.
- **Features:**
  - Interactive menu for selecting statistical operations.
  - Data visualization using histograms.
  - Allows for repeated calculations without restarting the program.
 
## Key Concepts Covered

- **Statistical Analysis:** Understand and compute basic statistical measures.
- **Python Functions:** Modularize code using functions for different calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Manage user input and handle exceptions gracefully.
- It also includes a `quick_select` algorithm for efficient median calculation.
